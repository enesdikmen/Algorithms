1.This tree would be like having 3 completely different trees but each node take space only once at 
memory. So for each insertion we actually insert to 3 different trees. Since insertion operations 
complexity is logn this insertion would cost 3logn which is also equal to logn in asymptotic notation.
Answer: logn 

2.To calculate standart deviation at a node we need to traverse every node of mini-b tree. Mini b-tree
contains 2t-1 keys(log(t)time). So for instertion at every node we iterate we will do this.
Answer: logn*logt
